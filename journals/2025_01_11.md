		  The party of four Level 5 characters stumbles upon a grand, abandoned library with towering shelves filled with ancient tomes.

Upon entry, the party is confronted by **The Archivist Golem** and its accompanying **Sentient Librarians**, who are determined to protect the sanctity of the library.

		- The ogre is too stupid to retreat and will fight to the death.
