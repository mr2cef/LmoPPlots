		  ---
		- ## **Battle Stages:**
		- ### **Stage 1: The Wall Defense**
		- Players must break through the gates or scale the wooden walls.
		- **Environmental Hazards:**
			- **Boulders from the Mountain:** Earthbenders can dislodge boulders from the mountain, rolling them downhill. Each boulder is a 10-ft-wide obstacle. Any creature in its path must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
			- **Cracking Walls:** Earthbenders can spend an action to collapse a portion of the wall, creating difficult terrain (15 ft. radius).
		- The **4 Earthbender Soldiers** provide ranged support and try to keep players at bay.
		  
		  ---
		- ### **Stage 2: The Commander and the Stone Golem**
		- Once the players breach the walls, the **Commander** and **Stone Golem** enter the fight. The Commander stays near the tents, using barriers to divide and conquer the party.
		- **Environmental Hazards:**
			- **Tents Catch Fire:** If players use fire spells or fire damage, tents may catch fire, filling a 10-ft radius with smoke. Creatures in the smoke are **blinded** unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
			- **Earth Spikes:** The Commander creates spike-filled areas (10-ft radius) as part of the Earth Wave, turning them into difficult terrain that deals 7 (2d6) piercing damage when crossed.
			  
			  The **Stone Golem** serves as the primary tank, soaking up damage while the Commander uses barriers and abilities to pick off vulnerable characters.

			  **Challenge **3 (700 XP)
			- **ACTIONS**
			  **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d6 - 1) piercing damage.
			  **Magic Wand. **The kamek shoots up to two of the following 
			  magical rays at one or two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. It
			   can use each ray only once on a turn. The magic wand does not function 
			  for non-kameks.
			- *Confusion Ray.* The target mus succeed 
			  on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the end
			  of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses its 
			  action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined 
			  creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on 
			  its turn.
			- *Paralyzing Ray.* The target must 
			  succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 
			  minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
			  turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
			- *Fear Ray. *The target must succeed on a
			  DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
			  repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with 
			  disadvantage if the kamek is visible to the target, ending the effect on
			  itself on a success.
			- *Wounding Ray. *The target must make a 
			  DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a 
			  failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
			  
			  **REACTIONS**
			  **Spell Reflection.** If the kamek makes a successful saving 
			  throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the kamek can choose
			  another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet 
			  of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the kamek. If 
			  the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save.
			  If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the 
			  chosen creature.
			  
			  Kameks close to within 60 feet of the heroes, flying at all times, to 
			  try and harry them with ranged blasts from their magic wands. If a kamek
			  dies over solid ground, the characters can retrieve and immediately use
			  its broom of flying. If a kamek is killed over lava, its broom falls 
			  into the lava and is destroyed. If you want to step up the difficulty of
			  the challenge a bit further, you can have it where defeating Bowser 
			  before killing all the kameks causes Bowser to rise again as a 
			  dracoturtlich. (I leave that to you to stat up.)

			- **Fire Absorption.** Whenever the piranha plant is subjected 
			  to fire damage, it takes no damage and and hurls a mote of fire at a 
			  target of its choice within 60 feet as a reaction. The target must make a
			  DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to the amount of
			  fire damage to which the piranha plant was subjected. A successful save
			  reduces the damage by half.
			- **ACTIONS**
			- **Multiattack. **The piranha plant makes two bite attacks. If 
			  both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled 
			  (escape DC 14), and the piranha plant uses its Engulf on it.
			- **Bite. **Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
			- **Engulf.** The piranha plant engulfs a Medium or smaller

			  unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving 
			  throw at the start of each of the pirahna plant's turns or take 13 (2d8 +
			  4) bludgeoning damage. If the piranha plant is moved, the engulfed 
			  target moves with it. The piranha plant can have only one creature 
			  engulfed at a time.
