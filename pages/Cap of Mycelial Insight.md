  **Properties:**
- **Arcane Amplification:**
  The hat grants a **+1 bonus to your Spell Save DC** and **+1 bonus to your AC against spell attacks**.
- **Sporebound Connection:**
  While wearing this hat, you can designate a companion creature (such as a familiar or summoned creature) as the center for your spells.
	- You can use your companion as the origin point for any spell you cast, provided the spell's range is not "Self."
	- Your companion can deliver touch spells as if you had cast them yourself, as long as it is within 30 feet of you.
- **Defensive Spores:**
  Once per long rest, when you are targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to release a burst of defensive spores. The attacker must succeed on a **Constitution saving throw (DC 15)** or have **disadvantage** on their attack roll.
