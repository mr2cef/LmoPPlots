- ### **Background:**
  
  Durga Bristlebraid once served as a **Runesmith-General** in the [[Emberguard War College]], designing magical siege engines and rune-bound wargear. After a *disastrous love affair* with an elven enchanter (whom she now only refers to as "Twigface"), she left the military, *disgusted with bureaucracy and heartache*, and set up a booming trade in rare magical artifacts.
  
  She now runs **"Bristlebraid's Bound Wonders"**, a mobile cart-shop reinforced with glyphs of warding, dragged by a heavily-armored dire badger named *Pinto*. Durga travels from city to city, **scowling at amateurs**, **barking prices**, and **inspecting wares with monocle-enhanced fury**.

- ### **Secrets:**
- **Common Secret (easily discoverable):** Durga was once engaged to a high elf noble, a union forbidden by both families. She hates talking about it‚Äîbut it's *common tavern gossip*.
- **Hidden Secret (difficult to uncover):** One of the artifacts in her possession is an actual *phylactery*, disguised as a cursed music box. She doesn‚Äôt *know* what it is‚Äîyet.
